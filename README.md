# Ai-symptoms-checker-
An AI symptoms checker is a digital tool that uses artificial intelligence to analyze user-reported symptoms and suggest possible conditions. It asks follow-up questions, provides condition suggestions, and offers guidance on whether to seek medical help. It's a quick, helpful pre-diagnosis aid—not a substitute for a doctor.
